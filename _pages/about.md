Sons of Saturn is primarily solo-developed by Charles Lawson.  Charles collected and edited nearly all of the image assets used and was responsible for programming the game and writing the script.

Music Producer Seth Emans provided several compositions for the Sons of Saturn soundtrack.  You can find more of his work [here.]:(https://singularity27-productions.bandcamp.com/music)

Artist Alex Burden provided several collage pieces seen throughout the game, and created the *Grand Subteranean Line*, the larger underground world of which Sons of Saturn is a part.  You can find more of his work at *Fill in*
